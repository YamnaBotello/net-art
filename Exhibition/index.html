            The exhibition "Digital Perspectives: Exploring Net Art" brings together three pivotal works that challenge conventional boundaries of art, technology, and the digital realm. From early web art to interactive pieces, these works explore themes of intimacy, generative algorithms, and the glitchy nature of our digital lives. Olia Lialina’s "My Boyfriend Came Back From the War" taps into the emotional potential of the web, while Galloway, Tribe, and Wattenberg's "StarryNight" engages with the generative power of algorithms. Netochka Nezvanova's "m9ndfukc.0+99" confronts the viewer with chaotic, fragmented visuals, making these works powerful expressions of digital art in a networked world.

        <h2>"My Boyfriend Came Back From the War" (1996) by Olia Lialina</h2>
        <p> “My Boyfriend Came Back From the War” by Olia Lialina was one of the earliest examples of net art and it was an interactive web-based narrative that uses very simple HTML to tell a very emotional story of a relationship that is disrupted by technology. It allows the user to click through a series of hyperlinked pages that reveal how digital communication and online spaces have affected real relationships, highlighting the emotional distance in a networked world. </p>

        <h2>"StarryNight" (1999) by Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg</h2>
        <p>"StarryNight" by Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg was developed as an interactive interface for Rhizome’s Textbase archive, a curated collection of emails from the late 1990s that documented critical discussions, resource-sharing, and artwork in email form. Each email in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light, with its brightness increasing as the message was accessed.

        <h2>"m9ndfukc.0+99" (2004) by Netochka Nezvanova</h2>
        <p>“m9ndfukc.0+99” by Netochka Nezvanova is a data visualization tool that transforms noise and randomness into art. Nezvanova’s work explored the artistic potential of chaotic data, and her influence extended to the development of NATO.0+55+3d, which later evolved into Jitter, a key tool in digital media production.
